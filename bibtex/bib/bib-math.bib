Only quadratic functions are considered but particular attention is paid to the magnitude of successive errors and their dependence upon the initial matrix. On the basis of this a possible explanation of some of the observed characteristics of the class is tentatively suggested.}},

  abstract = {{An approach to variable metric algorithms has been investigated in which the linear search sub-problem no longer becomes necessary. The property of quadratic termination has been replaced by one of monotonic convergence of the eigenvalues of the approximating matrix to the inverse hessian. A convex class of updating formulae which possess this property has been established, and a strategy has been indicated for choosing a member of the class so as to keep the approximation away from both singularity and unboundedness. A FORTRAN program has been tested extensively with encouraging results.}},
