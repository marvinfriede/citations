The molecular orbitals are written as linear combinations of gauge-invariant atomic orbitals, the wavefunctions in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field being determined by self-consistent field perturbation theory. The final magnetic shielding result is broken up into contributions which can be related to various features of electronic structure. Calculated magnetic shielding constants are presented using three sets of atomic orbitals, all of which are taken as contracted gaussian-type functions. The first two sets are minimal and the third is slightly extended. All three levels of theory give good descriptions of shielding at first row and hydrogen atoms. Carbon and hydrogen chemical shifts calculated at the extended level are in excellent agreement with experimental values.}

Phys.\hphantom{,}123, 241102 (2005)] is extended to the effective one-particle Kohn-Sham scheme of density functional theory. Several variants of the resultant theory are discussed. Although they are in principle equivalent, consideration of computational efficiency strongly favors the one (F{\textasciimacron}+) in which the effective potential remains untransformed. Further combined with the atomic approximation for the matrix X relating the small and large components of the Dirac spinors as well as a simple ansatz for correcting the two-electron picture change errors, a very elegant, accurate, and efficient infinite-order quasirelativistic approach is obtained, which is far simpler than all existing quasirelativistic theories and must hence be regarded as a breakthrough in relativistic quantum chemistry. In passing, it is also shown that the Dirac-Kohn-Sham scheme can be made as efficient as two-component approaches without compromising the accuracy. To demonstrate the performance of the new methods, atomic calculations on Hg and E117 are first carried out. The spectroscopic constants (bond length, vibrational frequency, and dissociation energy) of E1172 are then reported. All the results are in excellent agreement with those of the Dirac-Kohn-Sham calculations.}

  abstract = {It is shown that four- and two-component relativistic Kohn-Sham methods of density functional theory can be made fully equivalent in all the aspects of simplicity, accuracy, and efficiency. In particular, this has been achieved based solely on physical arguments rather than on mathematical tricks. The central idea can be visualized as ``from atoms to molecule,'' reflecting that the atomic information is employed to ``synthesize'' the molecular no-pair relativistic Hamiltonian. That is, the molecular relativistic Hamiltonian can, without loss of accuracy, be projected onto the positive energy states of the isolated Dirac atoms with the projector approximated simply by the superposition of the atomic ones. The dimension of the four-component Hamiltonian matrix then becomes the same as that of a two-component one. Another essential ingredient is to formulate quasirelativistic theory on matrix form rather than on operator form. The resultant quasi-four-component, normalized elimination of the small component, and symmetrized elimination of the small component approaches are critically examined by taking the molecules of MH and M2 (M=At, E117) as examples.}

Spin-orbit coupling is thus taken into account for the evaluation of relativistically transformed (one-electron) Hamiltonian. As the relativistic decoupling transformation has to be evaluated with primitive functions, the construction of the relativistic one-electron Hamiltonian becomes the bottleneck of the whole calculation for large molecules. For the established exact-decoupling protocols, a minimal matrix operation count is established and discussed in detail. Furthermore, we apply our recently developed local DLU scheme [D. Peng and M. Reiher, J. Chem. Phys.\hphantom{,}136, 244108 (2012)]10.1063/1.4729788 to accelerate this step. With our new implementation two-component relativistic density functional calculations can be performed invoking the resolution-of-identity density-fitting approximation and (Abelian as well as non-Abelian) point group symmetry to accelerate both the exact-decoupling and the two-electron part. The capability of our implementation is illustrated at the example of silver clusters with up to 309 atoms, for which the cohesive energy is calculated and extrapolated to the bulk.}

  abstract   = {A nonempirical quantum mechanical method for the efficient and accurate quantification and analysis of intermolecular interactions is presented and tested on existing benchmark sets. The leading idea here is to focus on the intermolecular part of the correlation energy that contains the all-important London dispersion (LD) interaction. To keep the cost of the method low, essentially at the level of a Hartree--Fock (HF) calculation, the intramolecular part of the correlation energy is neglected. We also neglect the nondispersive parts of the intermolecular correlation energy. This scheme that we denote as Hartree--Fock plus London dispersion (HFLD) can be readily realized on the basis of the recently reported multilevel implementation of the domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled-cluster (DLPNO-CC) theory in conjunction with the well-established local energy decomposition (LED) analysis. The accuracy and efficiency of the HFLD method are evaluated on rare gas dimers, on the S66 and L7 benchmark sets of noncovalent interactions, and on an additional set (LP14) consisting of bulky Lewis pairs held together by intermolecular interactions of various strengths, with interaction energies ranging from -8 to -107 kcal/mol. It is first shown that the LD energy calculated with this approach is essentially identical to that obtained from the full DLPNO-CCSD(T)/LED calculation, with a mean absolute error of 0.2 kcal/mol on the S66 benchmark set. Moreover, in terms of the overall interaction energies, the HFLD method shows an efficiency that is comparable to that of the HF method, while retaining an accuracy between that of the DLPNO-CCSD and DLPNO-CCSD(T) schemes. Since the underlying DLPNO-CCSD method is linear scaling with respect to the system size, the HFLD approach also does not lead to new bottlenecks for large systems. As an illustrative example of its efficiency, the HFLD scheme was applied to the interaction between the substrate and the residues in the active site of the cyclohexanone monooxygenase enzyme. The excellent cost/performance ratio indicates that the HFLD method opens new avenues for the accurate calculation and analysis of noncovalent interaction energies in large molecular systems.},

In this work, we present a scheme for decomposing the DLPNO-CCSD(T) interaction energy between two molecules into physical meaningful contributions, providing a quantification of the most important components of the chemical interaction. The method, called Local Energy Decomposition (LED), is straightforward and requires negligible additional computing time. Both the Hartree--Fock and the correlation energy are decomposed into contributions from localized or pairs of localized occupied orbitals. Assigning these localized orbitals to fragments allows one to differentiate between intra- and intermolecular contributions to the interaction energy. Accordingly, the interaction energy can be decomposed into electronic promotion, electrostatic, exchange, dynamic charge polarization, and dispersion contributions. The LED scheme is applied to a number of test cases ranging from weakly, dispersively bound complexes to systems with strong ionic interactions. The dependence of the results on the one-particle basis set and various technical aspects, such as the localization scheme, are carefully studied in order to ensure that the results do not suffer from technical artifacts. A numerical comparison between the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/LED and the popular symmetry adapted perturbation theory (DFT-SAPT) is made, and the limitations of the proposed scheme are discussed.},

Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) schemes provide in-depth insights into their nature by decomposing interaction energies into additive contributions, such as electrostatics, polarization, and London dispersion. Although modern local variants of the ``gold standard'' coupled-cluster singles and doubles method plus perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) have made it possible to accurately quantify NCIs for relatively large systems, extracting chemically meaningful energy terms from such high level electronic structure calculations has been a long lasting challenge in computational chemistry. This review describes basic principles, interpretative aspects and applications of recently developed coupled cluster-based EDAs for the analysis of NCIs. The focus is on computationally efficient methods for systems with a few hundred atoms, for example, the recently introduced local energy decomposition analysis. In order to draw connections between different interpretative frameworks, these schemes are compared with other popular approaches for the quantification and analysis of NCIs, such as Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory and supermolecular EDAs based on mean-field as well as correlated approaches. Strengths and limitations of the various techniques are discussed.

  abstract  = {The molecular structure hypothesis - that a molecule is a collection of atoms linked by a network of bonds - was forged in the crucible of nineteenth-century experimental chemistry and has continued to serve as the principal means of ordering and classifying the observations of chemistry. There is a difficulty with the hypothesis, however, in that it is not related directly to the physics which governs the motions of the nuclei and electrons that make up the atoms and the bonds. It is the purpose of this important new book to show that a theory can be developed to underpin the molecular structure hypothesis - that the atoms in a molecule are real, with properties predicted and defined by the laws of quantum mechanics, and that the structure their presence imparts to a molecule is indeed a consequence of the underlying physics.  As a result the classification based upon the concept of atoms in molecules is freed from its empirical constraints and the full predictive power of quantum mechanics.  As a result the full predictive power of quantum mechanics can be incorporated into the resulting theory - a theory of atoms in molecules. The book is aimed at those scientists responsible for performing the experiments and collecting the observations on the properties of matter at the atomic level, in the belief that the transformation of qualitative concepts into a quantitative theory will serve to deepen our understanding of chemistry.},
