  abstract = {Abstract A straightforward modification of the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation to the Coulomb interaction is described. In the limit of basis sets that are dominated by high angular momentum functions the observed speedups in realistic test systems reach a factor of 2 compared to the standard RI algorithm, and a factor of up to 300 compared to the standard algorithm to form the Coulomb matrix. More moderate savings on the order of 0–20\% are obtained for the more commonly used smaller basis sets. A series of test calculations is reported to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.},

These basis sets are counterparts for relativistic all-electron calculations to the Karlsruhe ``def2'' basis sets for nonrelativistic (H--Kr) or effective core potential based (Rb--Rn) treatments. For maximum consistency, the bases presented here were obtained from the latter by modification and reoptimization. Additionally we present extensions for self-consistent two-component calculations, required for the splitting of inner shells by spin--orbit coupling, and auxiliary basis sets for fitting the Coulomb part of the Fock matrix. Emphasis was put both on the accuracy of energies of atomic orbitals and on the accuracy of molecular properties. A large set of more than 300 molecules representing (nearly) all elements in their common oxidation states was used to assess the quality of the bases all across the periodic table.}

  abstract = {Seven different types of Slater type basis sets for the elements H (Z = 1) up to E118 (Z = 118), ranging from a double zeta valence quality up to a quadruple zeta valence quality, are tested in their performance in neutral atomic and diatomic oxide calculations. The exponents of the Slater type functions are optimized for the use in (scalar relativistic) zeroth-order regular approximated (ZORA) equations. Atomic tests reveal that, on average, the absolute basis set error of 0.03 kcal/mol in the density functional calculation of the valence spinor energies of the neutral atoms with the largest all electron basis set of quadruple zeta quality is lower than the average absolute difference of 0.16 kcal/mol in these valence spinor energies if one compares the results of ZORA equation with those of the fully relativistic Dirac equation. This average absolute basis set error increases to about 1 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of triple zeta valence quality, and to approximately 4 kcal/mol for the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality. The molecular tests reveal that, on average, the calculated atomization energies of 118 neutral diatomic oxides MO, where the nuclear charge Z of M ranges from Z = 1--118, with the all electron basis sets of triple zeta quality with two polarization functions added are within 1--2 kcal/mol of the benchmark results with the much larger all electron basis sets, which are of quadruple zeta valence quality with four polarization functions added. The accuracy is reduced to about 4--5 kcal/mol if only one polarization function is used in the triple zeta basis sets, and further reduced to approximately 20 kcal/mol if the all electron basis sets of double zeta quality are used. The inclusion of g-type STOs to the large benchmark basis sets had an effect of less than 1 kcal/mol in the calculation of the atomization energies of the group 2 and group 14 diatomic oxides. The basis sets that are optimized for calculations using the frozen core approximation (frozen core basis sets) have a restricted basis set in the core region compared to the all electron basis sets. On average, the use of these frozen core basis sets give atomic basis set errors that are approximately twice as large as the corresponding all electron basis set errors and molecular atomization energies that are close to the corresponding all electron results. Only if spin-orbit coupling is included in the frozen core calculations larger errors are found, especially for the heavier elements, due to the additional approximation that is made that the basis functions are orthogonalized on scalar relativistic core orbitals.},

  abstract = {The basis-set convergence towards the numerical limit of the Hartree--Fock total energy and binding energy is investigated for the correlation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets. For both energies, solid improvements are obtained with each increment in X. The basis-set errors for the total energy ({$\Delta$}E) fit an exponential form better than a power form, and the total energy is better fitted than the binding energy. It is difficult to find generally reliable extrapolation schemes for the total energy. In most cases, the most successful scheme gives results extrapolated beyond a given X that are comparable to the cc-pV(X+1)Z results, but occasionally it fails dramatically for large X. Indeed, explicit calculation of the energy in a larger basis set, especially the cc-pV6Z set for which {$\Delta$}E{$\leq$}0.1 mEh, gives the most reliable estimate of the basis-set limit.}

  abstract = {We present a sequence of n-tuple-{$\zeta$} augmented polarized (nZaP) basis sets designed for extrapolations of both self-consistent field (SCF) and correlation energies to the complete basis set (CBS) limit. These nZaP basis sets (n=2--6) are formulated to give consistent errors throughout the Periodic Table (e.g., a consistent of {$\sim$}1{\enspace}mhartree/electron error for the 2ZaP SCF energy and a consistent of {$\sim$}1.4{\enspace}{$\mu$}hartree/electron error for the 6ZaP SCF energy). The SCF energy exhibits systematic convergence to the CBS limit: ESCF(nZaP){$\approx$}ESCF(CBS)+Ae-an. A single parameter, a=6.30, describes the 2ZaP through 6ZaP errors of H through Xe within 10\%. The SCF rms basis set truncation errors of H through Xe are 33.5mEh, 4.58mEh, 0.82mEh, 0.18mEh, and 0.047mEh for 2ZaP, 3ZaP, 4ZaP, 5ZaP, and 6ZaP, respectively. Linear extrapolations of the (2,3)ZaP, (3,4)ZaP, (4,5)ZaP, and (5,6)ZaP calculations (all with a=6.30) reduce these errors by an order of magnitude to 0.24mEh, 0.056mEh, 0.020mEh, and 0.005mEh, respectively. A test set of 34 atoms, ions, and molecules gives similar results, and the associated test set of 25 chemical energy differences also gives comparable absolute accuracy. However, the cancellation of errors between reactant and product is lost by extrapolation. As a result, these chemical energy differences show a more modest two-to-fourfold improvement with extrapolation.}

For the extrapolations to the basis-set limit of the correlation energies, fits of the form a+bX-3 (where X is two for double-zeta sets, three for triple-zeta sets, etc.) are found to be useful. CCSD(T) calculations involving as many as 492 atomic orbitals are reported.}

Correlation-consistent polarized valence and core-valence basis sets up to sextuple zeta quality are employed. Guided by basis-set limits established by rij-dependent methods, a number of extrapolation schemes for use with the correlation-consistent basis sets are investigated. Among the schemes considered here, a linear least-squares procedure applied to the quintuple and sextuple zeta results yields the most accurate extrapolations.}
