  abstract = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or simply \^aautodiff\^a, is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for efficiently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established field with applications in areas including computational fluid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the fields of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other's results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names \^adynamic computational graphs\^a and \^adifferentiable programming\^a. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely defining the main differentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms \^aautodiff\^a, \^aautomatic differentiation\^a, and \^asymbolic differentiation\^a as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

  abstract = {A lot of progress has been made in recent years in the development of atomistic potentials using machine learning (ML) techniques. In contrast to most conventional potentials, which are based on physical approximations and simplifications to derive an analytic functional relation between the atomic configuration and the potential-energy, ML potentials rely on simple but very flexible mathematical terms without a direct physical meaning. Instead, in case of ML potentials the topology of the potential-energy surface is ``learned'' by adjusting a number of parameters with the aim to reproduce a set of reference electronic structure data as accurately as possible. Due to this bias-free construction, they are applicable to a wide range of systems without changes in their functional form, and a very high accuracy close to the underlying first-principles data can be obtained. Neural network potentials (NNPs), which have first been proposed about two decades ago, are an important class of ML potentials. Although the first NNPs have been restricted to small molecules with only a few degrees of freedom, they are now applicable to high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms, which enables addressing a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and materials science. In this tutorial review, the basic ideas of NNPs are presented with a special focus on developing NNPs for high-dimensional condensed systems. A recipe for the construction of these potentials is given and remaining limitations of the method are discussed. \textcopyright{} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Semiempirical (SE) methods can be derived from either Hartree-Fock or density functional theory by applying systematic approximations, leading to efficient computational schemes that are several orders of magnitude faster than ab initio calculations. Such numerical efficiency, in combination with modern computational facilities and linear scaling algorithms, allows application of SE methods to very large molecular systems with extensive conformational sampling. To reliably model the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of biological and other soft matter systems, however, good accuracy for the description of noncovalent interactions is required. In this review, we analyze popular SE approaches in terms of their ability to model noncovalent interactions, especially in the context of describing biomolecules, water solution, and organic materials. We discuss the most significant errors and proposed correction schemes, and we review their performance using standard test sets of molecular systems for quantum chemical methods and several recent applications. The general goal is to highlight both the value and limitations of SE methods and stimulate further developments that allow them to effectively complement ab initio methods in the analysis of complex molecular systems.},

The central assumptions behind this effective charge-charge interaction are the inverse relation of atomic size and chemical hardness and the use of a fixed chemical hardness parameter independent of the atomic charge state. While these approximations seem to be unproblematic for many covalently bound systems, they are quantitatively insufficient for hydrogen-bonding interactions and (anionic) molecules with localized net charges. Here, we present an extension of the SCC-DFTB method to incorporate third-order terms in the charge density fluctuations, leading to chemical hardness parameters that are dependent on the atomic charge state and a modification of the Coulomb scaling to improve the electrostatic treatment within the second-order terms. These modifications lead to a significant improvement in the description of hydrogen-bonding interactions and proton affinities of biologically relevant molecules.},

  abstract = {An extended semiempirical tight-binding model is presented, which is primarily designed for the fast calculation of structures and noncovalent interaction energies for molecular systems with roughly 1000 atoms. The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density fluctuation effects via short-range damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-specific parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density fluctuations. Fully analytical and numerically precise gradients (nuclear forces) are implemented. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked for a wide variety of systems and compared with other semiempirical methods. Along with excellent performance for the ``target'' properties, we also find lower errors for ``off-target'' properties such as barrier heights and molecular dipole moments. High computational efficiency along with the improved physics compared to its precursor GFN-xTB makes this method well-suited to explore the conformational space of molecular systems. Significant improvements are furthermore observed for various benchmark sets, which are prototypical for biomolecular systems in aqueous solution.},

  abstract = {A black-box type procedure is presented for the generation of molecule-specific, classical potential energy functions (force-field, FF) solely from quantum mechanically (QM) computed input data. The approach can treat covalently bound molecules and noncovalent complexes with almost arbitrary structure. The necessary QM information consists of the equilibrium structure and the corresponding Hessian matrix, atomic partial charges, and covalent bond orders. The FF fit is performed automatically without any further input and yields a specific (nontransferable) potential which very closely resembles the QM reference potential near the equilibrium. The resulting atomistic, fully flexible FF is anharmonic and allows smooth dissociation of covalent bonds into atoms. A newly proposed force-constant\textendash bond-energy relation with little empiricism provides reasonably accurate (about 5\textendash 10\% error) atomization energies for almost arbitrary diatomic and polyatomic molecules. Intra- and intermolecular noncovalent interactions are treated by using well established and accurate D3 dispersion coefficients, CM5 charges from small basis set QM calculations, and a new interatomic repulsion potential. Particular attention has been paid to the construction of the torsion potentials which are partially obtained from automatic QM-tight-binding calculations for model systems. Detailed benchmarks are presented for conformational energies, atomization energies, vibrational frequencies, gas phase structures of organic molecules, and transition metal complexes. Comparisons to results from standard FF or semiempirical methods reveal very good accuracy of the new potential. While further studies are necessary to validate the approach, the initial results suggest QMDFF as a routine tool for the computation of a wide range of properties and systems (e.g., for molecular dynamics of isolated molecules, explicit solvation, self-solvation (melting) or even for molecular crystals) in particular when standard parametrizations are unavailable.},

We show that the excitation energies of charge transfer states are improved relative to the standard approach without the long-range correction by testing the method on a set of molecules from the database in Peach et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 128, 044118 (2008)] which are known to exhibit problematic charge transfer states. The degree of spatial overlap between occupied and virtual orbitals indicates where TD-DFTB and long-range corrected TD-DFTB (lc-TD-DFTB) can be expected to produce large errors. Second, we improve the calculation of oscillator strengths. The transition dipoles are obtained from Slater Koster files for the dipole matrix elements between valence orbitals. In particular, excitations localized on a single atom, which appear dark when using Mulliken transition charges, acquire a more realistic oscillator strength in this way. These extensions pave the way for using lc-TD-DFTB to describe the electronic structure of large chromophoric polymers, where uncorrected TD-DFTB fails to describe the high degree of conjugation and produces spurious low-lying charge transfer states.},

This fact enables one to define a functional of the density F[n(r)] independent of v(r), such that the quantity {$\Omega$}={$\int$}v(r)n(r)dr+F[n(r)] is at a minimum and equal to the grand potential when n(r) is the equilibrium density in the grand ensemble in the presence of v(r).},

This paper describes both the API design and the system implementation of MXNet, and explains how embedding of both symbolic expression and tensor operation is handled in a unified fashion. Our preliminary experiments reveal promising results on large scale deep neural network applications using multiple GPU machines.},

A semi-theoretical means of estimating the core resonance integral is proposed and shown to give fair agreement with the empirical values for C-C, O-O, C-N, and C-O bonds.},

Compared with NeuroChem, TorchANI has a design emphasis on being lightweight, user friendly, cross platform, and easy to read and modify for fast prototyping, while allowing acceptable sacrifice on running performance. Because the computation of atomic environmental vectors and atomic neural networks are all implemented using PyTorch operators, TorchANI is able to use PyTorch's autograd engine to automatically compute analytical forces and Hessian matrices, as well as do force training without requiring any additional codes. TorchANI is open-source and freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/aiqm/torchani.},
