  abstract = {MP2 and CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limit interaction energies and geometries for more than 100 DNA base pairs, amino acid pairs and model complexes are for the first time presented together. Extrapolation to the CBS limit is done by using two-point extrapolation methods and different basis sets (aug-cc-pVDZ – aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ – aug-cc-pVQZ, cc-pVTZ – cc-pVQZ) are utilized. The CCSD(T) correction term, determined as a difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended. In this case larger basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and also CCSD(T) and counterpoise-corrected MP2 optimized geometries were sometimes adopted.},

  abstract = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.}
