  abstract = {The calculation of molecular bond energies is a sensitive test of exchange-correlation approximations in density functional theory. The well known local density approximation (LDA) gives excellent bond lengths and vibrational frequencies, but seriously overestimates dissociation energies. Therefore, we have investigated the effect on bond energies of nonlocal corrections to the LDA exchange-correlation functional. We consider the nonlocal correction term of Langreth and Mehl, and also a new semiempirical exchange energy correction. Significant improvements over the LDA dissociation energies are obtained in calculations on first-, second-, and third-row homonuclear diatomic systems.}

  abstract = {In the past 30 years, density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as the most widely used electronic structure method to predict the properties of various systems in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Despite a long history of successes, state-of-the-art DFT functionals have crucial limitations. In particular, significant systematic errors are observed for charge densities involving mobile charges and spins. Kirkpatrick et al. developed a framework to train a deep neural network on accurate chemical data and fractional electron constraints (see the Perspective by Perdew). The resulting functional outperforms traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. The present work offers a solution to a long-standing critical problem in DFT and demonstrates the success of combining DFT with the modern machine-learning methodology. —YS Deep learning solves a long-standing critical limitation of density functional theory in describing fractional charges and spins. Density functional theory describes matter at the quantum level, but all popular approximations suffer from systematic errors that arise from the violation of mathematical properties of the exact functional. We overcame this fundamental limitation by training a neural network on molecular data and on fictitious systems with fractional charge and spin. The resulting functional, DM21 (DeepMind 21), correctly describes typical examples of artificial charge delocalization and strong correlation and performs better than traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. DM21 accurately models complex systems such as hydrogen chains, charged DNA base pairs, and diradical transition states. More crucially for the field, because our methodology relies on data and constraints, which are continually improving, it represents a viable pathway toward the exact universal functional.}

The new functionals are called PW6B95 (6-parameter functional based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation) and PWB6K (6-parameter functional for kinetics based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation). The resulting methods were comparatively assessed against the MGAE109/3 main group atomization energy database, against the IP13/3 ionization potential database, against the EA13/3 electron affinity database, against the HTBH38/4 and NHTBH38/04 hydrogen-transfer and non-hydrogen-transfer barrier height databases, against the HB6/04 hydrogen bonding database, against the CT7/04 charge-transfer complex database, against the DI6/04 dipole interaction database, against the WI7/05 weak interaction database, and against the new PPS5/05 π−π stacking interaction database. From the assessment and comparison of methods, we draw the following conclusions, based on an analysis of mean unsigned errors: (i) The PW6B95, MPW1B95, B98, B97-1, and TPSS1KCIS methods give the best results for a combination of thermochemistry and nonbonded interactions. (ii) PWB6K, MPWB1K, BB1K, MPW1K, and MPW1B95 give the best results for a combination of thermochemical kinetics and nonbonded interactions. (iii) PWB6K outperforms the MP2 method for nonbonded interactions. (iv) PW6B95 gives errors for main group covalent bond energies that are only 0.41 kcal (as measured by mean unsigned error per bond (MUEPB) for the MGAE109 database), as compared to 0.56 kcal/mol for the second best method and 0.92 kcal/mol for B3LYP.},

  abstract = {A quantum chemical method based on a Hartree-Fock calculation with a small Gaussian AO basis set is presented. Its main area of application is the computation of structures, vibrational frequencies, and noncovalent interaction energies in huge molecular systems. The method is suggested as a partial replacement of semiempirical approaches or density functional theory (DFT) in particular when self-interaction errors are acute. In order to get accurate results three physically plausible atom pair-wise correction terms are applied for London dispersion interactions (D3 scheme), basis set superposition error (gCP scheme), and short-ranged basis set incompleteness effects. In total nine global empirical parameters are used. This so-called Hartee-Fock-3c (HF-3c) method is tested for geometries of small organic molecules, interaction energies and geometries of noncovalently bound complexes, for supramolecular systems, and protein structures. In the majority of realistic test cases good results approaching large basis set DFT quality are obtained at a tiny fraction of computational cost. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{pbeh-3c,
  abstract   = {A density functional theory (DFT) based composite electronic structure approach is proposed to efficiently compute structures and interaction energies in large chemical systems. It is based on the well-known and numerically robust Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff (PBE) generalized-gradient-approximation in a modified global hybrid functional with a relatively large amount of non-local Fock-exchange. The orbitals are expanded in Ahlrichs-type valence-double zeta atomic orbital (AO) Gaussian basis sets, which are available for many elements. In order to correct for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) and to account for the important long-range London dispersion effects, our well-established atom-pairwise potentials are used. In the design of the new method, particular attention has been paid to an accurate description of structural parameters in various covalent and non-covalent bonding situations as well as in periodic systems. Together with the recently proposed three-fold corrected (3c) Hartree-Fock method, the new composite scheme (termed PBEh-3c) represents the next member in a hierarchy of {\textquotedbl}low-cost{\textquotedbl} electronic structure approaches. They are mainly free of BSSE and account for most interactions in a physically sound and asymptotically correct manner. PBEh-3c yields good results for thermochemical properties in the huge GMTKN30 energy database. Furthermore, the method shows excellent performance for non-covalent interaction energies in small and large complexes. For evaluating its performance on equilibrium structures, a new compilation of standard test sets is suggested. These consist of small (light) molecules, partially flexible, medium-sized organic molecules, molecules comprising heavy main group elements, larger systems with long bonds, 3d-transition metal systems, non-covalently bound complexes (S22 and S66$\times$8 sets), and peptide conformations. For these sets, overall deviations from accurate reference data are smaller than for various other tested DFT methods and reach that of triple-zeta AO basis set second-order perturbation theory (MP2/TZ) level at a tiny fraction of computational effort. Periodic calculations conducted for molecular crystals to test structures (including cell volumes) and sublimation enthalpies indicate very good accuracy competitive to computationally more involved plane-wave based calculations. PBEh-3c can be applied routinely to several hundreds of atoms on a single processor and it is suggested as a robust {\textquotedbl}high-speed{\textquotedbl} computational tool in theoretical chemistry and physics.},

Specifically, we adapt the existing pairwise geometrical counterpoise (gCP) approach to the def2-SVPD basis, and we develop a beyond-pairwise approach, DFT-C, which we parameterize across a small set of intermolecular interactions. Both gCP and DFT-C are evaluated against the traditional Boys-Bernardi counterpoise correction across a set of 3402 non-covalent binding energies and isomerization energies. We find that the DFT-C method represents a significant improvement over gCP, particularly for non-covalently-interacting molecular clusters. Moreover, DFT-C is transferable among density functionals and can be combined with existing functionals—such as B97M-V—to recover large-basis results at a fraction of the cost.}},
