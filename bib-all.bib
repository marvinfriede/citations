  abstract     = {MP2 and CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limit interaction energies and geometries for more than 100 DNA base pairs, amino acid pairs and model complexes are for the first time presented together. Extrapolation to the CBS limit is done by using two-point extrapolation methods and different basis sets (aug-cc-pVDZ – aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ – aug-cc-pVQZ, cc-pVTZ – cc-pVQZ) are utilized. The CCSD(T) correction term, determined as a difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended. In this case larger basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and also CCSD(T) and counterpoise-corrected MP2 optimized geometries were sometimes adopted.},

  abstract     = {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.}

  abstract = {Abstract A new density functional (DF) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) type for general chemistry applications termed B97-D is proposed. It is based on Becke's power-series ansatz from 1997 and is explicitly parameterized by including damped atom-pairwise dispersion corrections of the form C6 · R−6. A general computational scheme for the parameters used in this correction has been established and parameters for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP) are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochemical benchmark sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked aromatic molecules and group II element clusters, and for the computation of molecular geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard functionals. In summary, it is found that B97-D belongs to one of the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of only 3.8 kcal mol−1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good, reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the development to restrict the density functional description to shorter electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with medium to large interatomic distances by damped C6 · R−6 terms seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chemical method for large systems where dispersion forces are of general importance. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract   = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15{\%}-40{\%} compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C(6) coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10{\%}) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

Our method relies on the summation of interatomic C6 coefficients, derived from the electron density of a molecule or solid and accurate reference data for the free atoms. The mean absolute error in the C6 coefficients is 5.5 percent when compared to accurate experimental values for 1225 intermolecular pairs, irrespective of the employed exchange-correlation functional. We show that the effective atomic C6 coefficients depend strongly on the bonding environment of an atom in a molecule. Finally, we analyze the van der Waals radii and the damping function in the C6R-6 correction method for density-functional theory calculations.},

This is achieved by combining the Tkatchenko-Scheffler van der Waals (vdW) method [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 073005 (2009)] with the self-consistent screening equation of classical electrodynamics. This leads to a seamless description of polarization and depolarization for the polarizability tensor of molecules and solids. The screened long-range many-body vdW energy is obtained from the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation for a system of coupled oscillators. We show that the screening and the many-body vdW energy play a significant role even for rather small molecules, becoming crucial for an accurate treatment of conformational energies for biomolecules and binding of molecular crystals. The computational cost of the developed theory is negligible compared to the underlying electronic structure calculation.},

  abstract   = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 \AA, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 \AA ) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 \AA, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 \AA{} and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 \AA{} and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract   = {To make practical the molecular dynamics simulation of large scale reactive chemical systems (1000s of atoms), we developed ReaxFF, a force field for reactive systems. ReaxFF uses a general relationship between bond distance and bond order on one hand and between bond order and bond energy on the other hand that leads to proper dissociation of bonds to separated atoms. Other valence terms present in the force field (angle and torsion) are defined in terms of the same bond orders so that all these terms go to zero smoothly as bonds break. In addition, ReaxFF has Coulomb and Morse (van der Waals) potentials to describe nonbond interactions between all atoms (no exclusions). These nonbond interactions are shielded at short range so that the Coulomb and van der Waals interactions become constant as Rij \textrightarrow{} 0. We report here the ReaxFF for hydrocarbons. The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster. In turn, the PM3 is about 100 times faster than the QC calculations. Thus, with ReaxFF we hope to be able to study complex reactions in hydrocarbons.}

Metal-organic frameworks or biological macromolecules involve complex architectures and a large variety of elements. Yet, a general and broadly applicable theoretical method to describe the structures and interactions of molecules beyond the 1000-atom size regime semi-quantitatively is not self-evident. For this purpose, a generic force field named GFN-FF is presented, which is completely newly developed to enable fast structure optimizations and molecular-dynamics simulations for basically any chemical structure consisting of elements up to radon. The freely available computer program requires only starting coordinates and elemental composition as input from which, fully automatically, all potential-energy terms are constructed. GFN-FF outperforms other force fields in terms of generality and accuracy, approaching the performance of much more elaborate quantum-mechanical methods in many cases.},

  abstract = {Abstract This review covers a family of atomistic, mostly quantum chemistry (QC) based semiempirical methods for the fast and reasonably accurate description of large molecules in gas and condensed phase. The theory is derived from a density functional (DFT) perturbation expansion of the electron density in fluctuation terms to various orders similar to the original density functional tight binding model. The term “eXtended” in their name (xTB) emphasizes the parameter availability for almost the entire periodic table of elements (Z ≤ 86) and improvements of the underlying theory regarding, for example, the atomic orbital basis set, the level of multipole approximation and the treatment of the important electrostatic and dispersion interactions. A common feature of most members is their consistent parameterization on accurate gas phase theoretical reference data for geometries, vibrational frequencies and noncovalent interactions, which are the primary properties of interest in typical applications to systems composed of up to a few thousand atoms. Further specialized versions were developed for the description of electronic spectra and corresponding response properties. Besides a provided common theoretical background with some important implementation details in the efficient and free xtb program, various benchmarks for structural and thermochemical properties including (transition-)metal systems are discussed. The review is completed by recent extensions of the model to the force-field (FF) level as well as its application to solids under periodic boundary conditions. The general applicability together with the excellent cost-accuracy ratio and the high robustness make the xTB family of methods very attractive for various fields of computer-aided chemical research. This article is categorized under: Electronic Structure Theory > Ab Initio Electronic Structure Methods Electronic Structure Theory > Semiempirical Electronic Structure Methods Software > Quantum Chemistry},

  abstract = {Abstract A simplified LCAO-DFT-LDA scheme for calculations of structure and electronic structure of large molecules, clusters, and solids is presented. Forces on the atoms are calculated in a semiempirical way considering the electronic states. The small computational effort of this treatment allows one to perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of molecules and clusters up to a few hundred atoms as well as corresponding simulations of condensed systems within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The accuracy of the method is illustrated by the results of calculations for a series of small molecules and clusters. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {The calculation of molecular bond energies is a sensitive test of exchange-correlation approximations in density functional theory. The well known local density approximation (LDA) gives excellent bond lengths and vibrational frequencies, but seriously overestimates dissociation energies. Therefore, we have investigated the effect on bond energies of nonlocal corrections to the LDA exchange-correlation functional. We consider the nonlocal correction term of Langreth and Mehl, and also a new semiempirical exchange energy correction. Significant improvements over the LDA dissociation energies are obtained in calculations on first-, second-, and third-row homonuclear diatomic systems.}

We construct a meta-GGA density functional for the exchange-correlation energy that satisfies exact constraints without empirical parameters. The exchange and correlation terms respect two paradigms: one- or two-electron densities and slowly varying densities, and so describe both molecules and solids with high accuracy, as shown by extensive numerical tests.

  abstract = {In the past 30 years, density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as the most widely used electronic structure method to predict the properties of various systems in chemistry, biology, and materials science. Despite a long history of successes, state-of-the-art DFT functionals have crucial limitations. In particular, significant systematic errors are observed for charge densities involving mobile charges and spins. Kirkpatrick et al. developed a framework to train a deep neural network on accurate chemical data and fractional electron constraints (see the Perspective by Perdew). The resulting functional outperforms traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. The present work offers a solution to a long-standing critical problem in DFT and demonstrates the success of combining DFT with the modern machine-learning methodology. —YS Deep learning solves a long-standing critical limitation of density functional theory in describing fractional charges and spins. Density functional theory describes matter at the quantum level, but all popular approximations suffer from systematic errors that arise from the violation of mathematical properties of the exact functional. We overcame this fundamental limitation by training a neural network on molecular data and on fictitious systems with fractional charge and spin. The resulting functional, DM21 (DeepMind 21), correctly describes typical examples of artificial charge delocalization and strong correlation and performs better than traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. DM21 accurately models complex systems such as hydrogen chains, charged DNA base pairs, and diradical transition states. More crucially for the field, because our methodology relies on data and constraints, which are continually improving, it represents a viable pathway toward the exact universal functional.}

The new functionals are called PW6B95 (6-parameter functional based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation) and PWB6K (6-parameter functional for kinetics based on Perdew-Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation). The resulting methods were comparatively assessed against the MGAE109/3 main group atomization energy database, against the IP13/3 ionization potential database, against the EA13/3 electron affinity database, against the HTBH38/4 and NHTBH38/04 hydrogen-transfer and non-hydrogen-transfer barrier height databases, against the HB6/04 hydrogen bonding database, against the CT7/04 charge-transfer complex database, against the DI6/04 dipole interaction database, against the WI7/05 weak interaction database, and against the new PPS5/05 π−π stacking interaction database. From the assessment and comparison of methods, we draw the following conclusions, based on an analysis of mean unsigned errors: (i) The PW6B95, MPW1B95, B98, B97-1, and TPSS1KCIS methods give the best results for a combination of thermochemistry and nonbonded interactions. (ii) PWB6K, MPWB1K, BB1K, MPW1K, and MPW1B95 give the best results for a combination of thermochemical kinetics and nonbonded interactions. (iii) PWB6K outperforms the MP2 method for nonbonded interactions. (iv) PW6B95 gives errors for main group covalent bond energies that are only 0.41 kcal (as measured by mean unsigned error per bond (MUEPB) for the MGAE109 database), as compared to 0.56 kcal/mol for the second best method and 0.92 kcal/mol for B3LYP.},

  abstract = {A quantum chemical method based on a Hartree-Fock calculation with a small Gaussian AO basis set is presented. Its main area of application is the computation of structures, vibrational frequencies, and noncovalent interaction energies in huge molecular systems. The method is suggested as a partial replacement of semiempirical approaches or density functional theory (DFT) in particular when self-interaction errors are acute. In order to get accurate results three physically plausible atom pair-wise correction terms are applied for London dispersion interactions (D3 scheme), basis set superposition error (gCP scheme), and short-ranged basis set incompleteness effects. In total nine global empirical parameters are used. This so-called Hartee-Fock-3c (HF-3c) method is tested for geometries of small organic molecules, interaction energies and geometries of noncovalently bound complexes, for supramolecular systems, and protein structures. In the majority of realistic test cases good results approaching large basis set DFT quality are obtained at a tiny fraction of computational cost. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{pbeh-3c,
  abstract   = {A density functional theory (DFT) based composite electronic structure approach is proposed to efficiently compute structures and interaction energies in large chemical systems. It is based on the well-known and numerically robust Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff (PBE) generalized-gradient-approximation in a modified global hybrid functional with a relatively large amount of non-local Fock-exchange. The orbitals are expanded in Ahlrichs-type valence-double zeta atomic orbital (AO) Gaussian basis sets, which are available for many elements. In order to correct for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) and to account for the important long-range London dispersion effects, our well-established atom-pairwise potentials are used. In the design of the new method, particular attention has been paid to an accurate description of structural parameters in various covalent and non-covalent bonding situations as well as in periodic systems. Together with the recently proposed three-fold corrected (3c) Hartree-Fock method, the new composite scheme (termed PBEh-3c) represents the next member in a hierarchy of {\textquotedbl}low-cost{\textquotedbl} electronic structure approaches. They are mainly free of BSSE and account for most interactions in a physically sound and asymptotically correct manner. PBEh-3c yields good results for thermochemical properties in the huge GMTKN30 energy database. Furthermore, the method shows excellent performance for non-covalent interaction energies in small and large complexes. For evaluating its performance on equilibrium structures, a new compilation of standard test sets is suggested. These consist of small (light) molecules, partially flexible, medium-sized organic molecules, molecules comprising heavy main group elements, larger systems with long bonds, 3d-transition metal systems, non-covalently bound complexes (S22 and S66$\times$8 sets), and peptide conformations. For these sets, overall deviations from accurate reference data are smaller than for various other tested DFT methods and reach that of triple-zeta AO basis set second-order perturbation theory (MP2/TZ) level at a tiny fraction of computational effort. Periodic calculations conducted for molecular crystals to test structures (including cell volumes) and sublimation enthalpies indicate very good accuracy competitive to computationally more involved plane-wave based calculations. PBEh-3c can be applied routinely to several hundreds of atoms on a single processor and it is suggested as a robust {\textquotedbl}high-speed{\textquotedbl} computational tool in theoretical chemistry and physics.},

We will discuss: (a) partial occupancies within the framework of the linear tetrahedron method and the finite temperature density-functional theory, (b) iterative methods for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian and a discussion of an efficient iterative method based on the ideas of Pulay's residual minimization, which is close to an order Natoms2 scaling even for relatively large systems, (c) efficient Broyden-like and Pulay-like mixing methods for the charge density including a new special ‘preconditioning’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set, (d) conjugate gradient methods for minimizing the electronic free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom simultaneously. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a fully stand-alone version of the Quantum Chemistry Electron Ionization Mass Spectra (QCEIMS) program [S. Grimme{,} Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.{,} 2013{,} 52{,} 6306] allowing efficient simulations for molecules composed of elements with atomic numbers up to Z = 86. The recently developed extended tight-binding semi-empirical method GFN-xTB has been combined with QCEIMS{,} thereby eliminating dependencies on third-party electronic structure software. Furthermore{,} for reasonable calculations of ionization potentials{,} as required by the method{,} a second tight-binding variant{,} IPEA-xTB{,} is introduced here. This novel combination of methods allows the automatic{,} fast and reasonably accurate computation of electron ionization mass spectra for structurally different molecules across the periodic table. In order to validate and inspect the transferability of the method{,} we perform large-scale simulations for some representative organic{,} organometallic{,} and main-group inorganic systems. Theoretical spectra for 23 molecules are compared directly to experimental data taken from standard databases. For the first time{,} realistic quantum chemistry based EI-MS for organometallic systems like ferrocene or copper(ii)acetylacetonate are presented. Compared to previously used semiempirical methods{,} GFN-xTB is faster{,} more robust{,} and yields overall higher quality spectra. The partially analysed theoretical reaction and fragmentation mechanisms are chemically reasonable and reveal in unprecedented detail the extreme complexity of high energy gas phase ion chemistry including complicated rearrangement reactions prior to dissociation.}

  abstract = {Abstract A straightforward modification of the resolution of the identity (RI) approximation to the Coulomb interaction is described. In the limit of basis sets that are dominated by high angular momentum functions the observed speedups in realistic test systems reach a factor of 2 compared to the standard RI algorithm, and a factor of up to 300 compared to the standard algorithm to form the Coulomb matrix. More moderate savings on the order of 0–20\% are obtained for the more commonly used smaller basis sets. A series of test calculations is reported to illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Comput Chem 24: 1740–1747, 2003},

The property of quadratic termination has been replaced by one of monotonic convergence of the eigenvalues of the approximating matrix to the inverse hessian. A convex class of updating formulae which possess this property has been established, and a strategy has been indicated for choosing a member of the class so as to keep the approximation away from both singularity and unboundedness. A FORTRAN program has been tested extensively with encouraging results.}},
