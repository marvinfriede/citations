 abstract = {The electron density, its gradient, and the Kohn-Sham orbital kinetic energy density are the local ingredients of a meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA). We construct a meta-GGA density functional for the exchange-correlation energy that satisfies exact constraints without empirical parameters. The exchange and correlation terms respect two paradigms: one- or two-electron densities and slowly varying densities, and so describe both molecules and solids with high accuracy, as shown by extensive numerical tests. This functional completes the third rung of {\textquotedbl}Jacob's ladder{\textquotedbl} of approximations, above the local spin density and GGA rungs.},

The new functionals are called PW6B95 (6-parameter functional based on Perdew−Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation) and PWB6K (6-parameter functional for kinetics based on Perdew−Wang-91 exchange and Becke-95 correlation). The resulting methods were comparatively assessed against the MGAE109/3 main group atomization energy database, against the IP13/3 ionization potential database, against the EA13/3 electron affinity database, against the HTBH38/4 and NHTBH38/04 hydrogen-transfer and non-hydrogen-transfer barrier height databases, against the HB6/04 hydrogen bonding database, against the CT7/04 charge-transfer complex database, against the DI6/04 dipole interaction database, against the WI7/05 weak interaction database, and against the new PPS5/05 π−π stacking interaction database. From the assessment and comparison of methods, we draw the following conclusions, based on an analysis of mean unsigned errors:  (i) The PW6B95, MPW1B95, B98, B97-1, and TPSS1KCIS methods give the best results for a combination of thermochemistry and nonbonded interactions. (ii) PWB6K, MPWB1K, BB1K, MPW1K, and MPW1B95 give the best results for a combination of thermochemical kinetics and nonbonded interactions. (iii) PWB6K outperforms the MP2 method for nonbonded interactions. (iv) PW6B95 gives errors for main group covalent bond energies that are only 0.41 kcal (as measured by mean unsigned error per bond (MUEPB) for the MGAE109 database), as compared to 0.56 kcal/mol for the second best method and 0.92 kcal/mol for B3LYP.},

@article{pbeh-3c,
 abstract = {A density functional theory (DFT) based composite electronic structure approach is proposed to efficiently compute structures and interaction energies in large chemical systems. It is based on the well-known and numerically robust Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhoff (PBE) generalized-gradient-approximation in a modified global hybrid functional with a relatively large amount of non-local Fock-exchange. The orbitals are expanded in Ahlrichs-type valence-double zeta atomic orbital (AO) Gaussian basis sets, which are available for many elements. In order to correct for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) and to account for the important long-range London dispersion effects, our well-established atom-pairwise potentials are used. In the design of the new method, particular attention has been paid to an accurate description of structural parameters in various covalent and non-covalent bonding situations as well as in periodic systems. Together with the recently proposed three-fold corrected (3c) Hartree-Fock method, the new composite scheme (termed PBEh-3c) represents the next member in a hierarchy of {\textquotedbl}low-cost{\textquotedbl} electronic structure approaches. They are mainly free of BSSE and account for most interactions in a physically sound and asymptotically correct manner. PBEh-3c yields good results for thermochemical properties in the huge GMTKN30 energy database. Furthermore, the method shows excellent performance for non-covalent interaction energies in small and large complexes. For evaluating its performance on equilibrium structures, a new compilation of standard test sets is suggested. These consist of small (light) molecules, partially flexible, medium-sized organic molecules, molecules comprising heavy main group elements, larger systems with long bonds, 3d-transition metal systems, non-covalently bound complexes (S22 and S66$\times$8 sets), and peptide conformations. For these sets, overall deviations from accurate reference data are smaller than for various other tested DFT methods and reach that of triple-zeta AO basis set second-order perturbation theory (MP2/TZ) level at a tiny fraction of computational effort. Periodic calculations conducted for molecular crystals to test structures (including cell volumes) and sublimation enthalpies indicate very good accuracy competitive to computationally more involved plane-wave based calculations. PBEh-3c can be applied routinely to several hundreds of atoms on a single processor and it is suggested as a robust {\textquotedbl}high-speed{\textquotedbl} computational tool in theoretical chemistry and physics.},
